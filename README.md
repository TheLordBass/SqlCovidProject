# SqlCovidProject
This project leverages SQL to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data collected from various regions worldwide. The dataset includes information such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing rates, and vaccination rollouts.

Key Highlights:
Data Cleaning and Preparation: Handling missing values, normalizing region names, and ensuring data consistency.
Trend Analysis: Identifying patterns in case counts, recovery rates, and death rates over time for different regions.
Regional Comparisons: Comparing COVID-19 metrics across continents, countries, and states to identify trends and outliers.
Query Examples:
Tracking daily and cumulative case counts.
Calculating recovery and fatality rates.
Analyzing the relationship between testing rates and case numbers.
Insights: Uncovered regional disparities in infection and recovery rates and analyzed the impact of vaccination rollouts.
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract actionable insights from public health data and highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in responding to global challenges.
